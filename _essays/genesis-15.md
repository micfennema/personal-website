Genesis 15 is a pivotal chapter in the Abrahamic narrative. It solidifies the promise of land and descendants, but more importantly, it establishes the covenant through a unique ritual.

> "And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness."

This verse (15:6) is central to Paul's argument in Romans regarding justification by faith. But in its original context, it serves as a response to Abram's doubt. The narrative clearly delineates between Abram's fear and God's reassurance.
