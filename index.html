        <p>
            I'm a wanna-be English major from Tucson, who got a BA in Economics in Chattanooga, and am now pursuing an
            MDiv in St. Louis.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can tell, I love learning and have trouble sticking to just one topic. One of the ways I love to
            learn is by making things I can share with others who might find them interesting too. This site is my way
            of doing that.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you look around, you'll find my reflections on books I'm reading, videos of my teachings, and a
            smattering of other things I've made over the years.
