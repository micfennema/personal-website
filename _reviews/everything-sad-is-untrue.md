I recently read *Everything Sad is Untrue* by Daniel Nayeri. It's a memoir, but it reads like a collection of myths.

Nayeri weaves his own story of fleeing Iran as a child with the stories of his ancestors and the myths of his people. It is a beautiful testament to the power of storytelling to preserve identity and make sense of a chaotic world.

> "A patchwork story is the shame of a refugee."

This line stuck with me. The disjointed nature of memory when you've been uprooted is a central theme. But Nayeri shows that this patchwork is also a work of art.
