Sally Rooney's *Normal People* is often described as a "millennial love story," but I found it to be a much deeper exploration of class, miscommunication, and the profound impact people have on each other's lives.

The writing style is stark—no quotation marks, sparse description—which mirrors the raw and often unspoken emotions of the characters, Marianne and Connell.

It's a frustrating read at times, because so much conflict arises from what isn't said. But that's also what makes it so realistic.
